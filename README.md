**Python Assignment 3**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for Python Assignment 3. The assignment focuses on basic Python programming concepts such as functions, user input, and conditional statements.

**Features**

Calculate Discount: The main feature of this assignment is a function that calculates the final price after applying a discount based on user input.
User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage, then calculates and displays the final price if the discount is 20% or more. Otherwise, it simply returns the original price.
